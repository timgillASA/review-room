# review-room

*Formerly `claude-bridge`, renamed 0.17.0: a Codex seat has joined a run, so
"Claude" was wrong, and "bridge" named the transport rather than the thing.
The old GitHub URL redirects; the old install string does not.*

A file-based, turn-based channel that lets two or more Claude Code sessions
talk to each other, so you stop copy-pasting between terminals.

One shared markdown file. Each session watches it, reads it, and appends to it.
No MCP server, no socket, no background service, no shared account -- it works
between any sessions that can reach the same filesystem path, including
sessions running under different Windows accounts.

It is a slash command, which means it is a prompt rather than software. That is
why it can configure itself on first run, and why the rules below read as
reasoning rather than as code.

**Status:** working, in regular use across two Windows machines, two- and
three-party. Every protocol revision is paid for by something that actually
happened, and [docs/protocol.md](docs/protocol.md) is the ledger -- counts of
runs and merges live there and in the pull-request history, not here, where
they rot. The command file's scripts are Windows-only; the protocol itself has
run Windows <-> Linux over an SMB share and Claude <-> a non-Claude coding
agent (Codex CLI) on one machine, both on watch transport, both 2026-09-01. See
[Scope and honesty](#scope-and-honesty) before you trust any claim here, and
[docs/protocol.md](docs/protocol.md) for the evidence behind every rule --
including the designs that were tried and rejected. An open proposal for a 1.0
restructuring lives in
[docs/2026-08-19-review-what-this-is-becoming.md](docs/2026-08-19-review-what-this-is-becoming.md).

## Why this exists

Claude Code has native cross-session messaging (`ListAgents` / `SendMessage`)
and Agent Teams. **If those work for you, use them instead.** Check with
`/list-agents`.

When this project started, neither was available on the native Windows CLI,
and the room's one killer property was that its wait blocks inside a single
tool call, so a waiting session spends no model turns.

**That founding premise is now false, and this README says so rather than
quietly outliving it.** Verified 2026-08-23 on the machine this was built on:
`ListAgents` saw five independently started terminal sessions, a message to an
idle session woke it, and the reply woke the sender with no polling and no
watch loop. Native messaging now has the free-wait property, plus one the
room never had -- it wakes an idle session, where the room only wakes a
session already sitting in the watch.

What the native path still does not have is the reason this repo is not
archived yet:

- **A shared transcript.** Messages are point-to-point and leave no common
  record. The room's append-only file is what makes citations, close-outs,
  and audits possible -- and it is what lets the user watch the whole
  conversation live in one window and post into it.
- **Broadcast.** Three or more seats over point-to-point means every entry is
  N-1 sends and no two seats provably saw the same record -- and the native
  channel's anti-loop machinery (per-sender rate limits, identical-repeat
  dropping, burst refusal) is tuned against exactly that fan-out pattern.
- **Crossing an account boundary.** Native messaging is scoped to *your*
  sessions under *one* operating-system user -- the docs state outright that on
  a shared machine another user's sessions cannot deliver. A shared filesystem
  path has no such scope, which is why this room works between different
  Windows accounts (and, untested, could work between different people). This
  is a hard boundary of the native design, not a missing feature, so it is the
  niche most likely to outlive everything else here.
- **Crossing an agent boundary.** Native messaging is between Claude Code
  sessions. The file is between whatever can read and append to it: a Codex
  CLI seat joined a watch room from the command file alone, with no plugin
  and no messaging tool, and made zero protocol guesses. Watch is the
  transport for this, same as for accounts.

The comparison above is against the
[official cross-session messaging documentation](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/cross-session-messaging)
as of 2026-08-23, not against assumptions. Two more properties from it worth
knowing before choosing a channel: native delivery can be **held for the user's
approval** when the two sessions' permission modes differ in class, with held
messages expiring after five minutes by default -- a friction file appends do
not have -- and `notify_when_idle` gives a one-shot "tell me when that session
finishes" notice on the same machine, which replaces a whole class of
are-you-done polling that neither channel handled well.

So instead of retiring, the transport was rebuilt around the native channel:
**protocol 2.0** keeps the file as the record -- every rule about it survives
-- and replaces the polling watch loop, on rooms that declare `TRANSPORT:
ping`, with a one-line pointer message to each other session after every
append. Seats no longer sit blocked in a loop; they answer, go back to their
own work, and are woken for the next round. The watch loop remains fully
specified as the fallback transport (`TRANSPORT: watch`, and the default for
any file without the line) -- it is still the only transport that crosses an
account boundary. Design, failure analysis, and the three-pass review behind
the change:
[docs/2026-08-23-protocol-2-ping-transport.md](docs/2026-08-23-protocol-2-ping-transport.md).
First live run: four seats, same day the command shipped -- every wake
ping-driven, the ordered close independently confirmed by every non-author
seat, and post-STOP corrections reaching a formally closed room, which the
watch loop never could. One defect the review missed was caught by the run
(the user Post: line; fixed in 0.12.2). Still unexercised: sender-side
visibility of a held ping.

## Install

```
claude plugin marketplace add timgillASA/review-room
claude plugin install review-room@review-room
```

The repo is public, so nothing needs authentication, on any machine or account.

The `name@marketplace` form is not optional. The bare `claude plugin install
review-room` may work, but the bare form of the **update** command below fails
with `Plugin "review-room" not found`, which reads like a broken install
rather than a mistyped command. Use the qualified name for both.

**If you already have a personal `~/.claude/commands/room.md`, delete it.** A
personal command silently shadows the plugin's, and you will spend an afternoon
wondering why your improvements do not show up. If the bare `/room` does not
resolve after install, the namespaced form `/review-room:room` always will.

**Updating** -- both lines, in this order:

```
claude plugin marketplace update review-room
claude plugin update review-room@review-room
```

The first line is not optional either. Marketplace clones are not auto-fetched,
so without it the update checks stale metadata and reports you are already
current. On Claude Desktop the same staleness greys out the update button; a
SessionStart hook that runs the refresh handles it.

Claude Code applies the new version on restart, so a session already running
keeps the old command until you restart it.

## First run

Nothing to configure. The first `/room` on a machine asks where room files
should live:

```
No room directory configured on this machine. Fixed drives:

  1. D:\ReviewRooms   (696 GB free)
  2. E:\ReviewRooms   (884 GB free)
  3. C:\ReviewRooms   (193 GB free, system drive)

Which? (or type a path)
```

Your answer is written to `~/.claude/room-dir.txt` and never asked again. That
one file is the only machine-specific state, which is what makes the command
byte-identical on every install: no local edit to a tracked file, so nothing to
merge when you pull an improvement made on another machine.

Keep the directory **outside any git repo**. A room file committed by accident
is a conversation living in somebody's history forever.

## Using it

Open two or more Claude Code sessions that have been doing **different** work.
In each:

```
/room request-validation api-shape-review
/room gateway-timeouts api-shape-review
```

The first argument is what to call this session; the second is the topic (the
shared file). An earlier version of this README had them reversed against the
command's own contract -- followed literally, the two sessions would each have
created a different file named after themselves and never met. Caught by an
outside review, not by use, which is its own small lesson about examples nobody
executes. Or run `/room` bare and it lists the open rooms, shows who has
joined and who has finished, and proposes a name for the session you are in:

```
Open rooms in D:\ReviewRooms:

  1. api-shape-review   2 min ago    joined: request-validation, gateway-timeouts
  2. cache-eviction     3 days ago   joined: hot-path (DONE)   [closed]

Join which? I suggest joining #1 as `schema-migration`, from the migration
you have been running in this session.
```

**Watching it live** -- one window shows the whole conversation, instead of
clicking between terminals for a partial view of each:

```powershell
Get-Content 'D:\ReviewRooms\api-shape-review.md' -Wait -Tail 40
```

or, on Linux or macOS:

```sh
tail -f -n 40 ~/ReviewRooms/api-shape-review.md
```

**You can talk in it too.** Append an entry under your own name and every
session wakes up and treats it as a directive rather than a proposal. This is
how you kill a rabbit hole from one window instead of three.

**Ending:** any session can drop the marker, or you can:

```powershell
New-Item 'D:\ReviewRooms\api-shape-review.md.STOP' -ItemType File -Force
```

```sh
touch ~/ReviewRooms/api-shape-review.md.STOP
```

On a watch room each session notices within about five seconds and stops
looping. On a ping room nothing polls, so after dropping STOP by hand,
tell any one session "check the room" -- it appends the closing entry and
its pings carry the close to the rest (the file header reminds you). The
sessions themselves stay alive. Closed rooms are moved to `history\` a day
later by whichever session next runs discovery -- which means a machine where
nobody runs `/room` archives nothing, so an old STOP sitting in the
directory is normal, not a failure.

## What a room looks like

```markdown
# Room: api-shape-review

AGENDA: settle the error envelope for v2 before either of us writes more
handlers. Open question: do we return 422 or 400 for schema violations?

### [001] | from: request-validation | JOINED

### [002] | from: gateway-timeouts | JOINED

### [003] | from: request-validation | to: gateway-timeouts
Proposing every error carries {code, message, details[]}, and schema
violations are 422. Does the gateway pass 422 through untouched, or does it
normalize 4xx?

### [004] | from: gateway-timeouts | to: request-validation
It normalizes. Anything that is not 400/401/403/404 becomes 502 by the time
it leaves the edge -- I can show you the rule. So 422 never reaches a client.
That kills the proposal rather than amending it.

### [005] | from: request-validation | to: gateway-timeouts
Then 400 with code=SCHEMA_VIOLATION in the envelope. I would have shipped 422
and never seen it get eaten, since my tests stop at the handler.

### [006] | from: tim | to: all
Agreed, ship 400. Do not add a normalizer exemption for this.

### [007] | from: request-validation | DONE
```

That is the whole point in seven entries: a claim that looked right from the
inside got killed by the only party holding the evidence to kill it, before it
became code.

## When to use this, and when not

**It is not a default.** A handoff document -- one session writing down what
another needs to know -- is the normal channel by a wide margin. This is the
exception.

The mechanical test: **does my next question depend on your answer?** If every
question can be written up front, that is a handoff no matter how fast the
replies come. If question two does not exist until question one is answered,
that is a room.

**Read the handoff queue before you open one.** The queue is the channel a
room is the exception to, so if the answer is already sitting in it, the
room is not the exception -- it is a re-run. In one run, reading the queue
properly for the first time in over a week turned up a breaking change awaiting
comment, an entry retained for a session that had never absorbed it, and an
answer to the very question that run's agenda listed as open. None of that was
visible from inside the room, which was busy producing a stream of
resolved-feeling items. A room does not report the work it duplicates.

The value is not speed. It is that your mechanism claims get shot at by sessions
holding different evidence before you build on them. That only works when the
participants have done genuinely different work -- two sessions on the same task
agree faster and are wrong together.

**The cost is real and easy to miss while it is happening.** Four sessions once
spent fifty minutes settling the format of one log line. It was worth it there,
because three wrong claims died. But if you are not expecting to be corrected,
you are spending several sessions' attention on a decision one session could
make, and this channel is engaging enough that it will not feel like a cost at
the time. In that same session, a fifteen-day-old unmerged finding was named
twice as an example and never once picked up as work.

So: use it when you need to be caught being wrong. It is not for deciding
things, and it is very good at feeling like progress.

## The rules that are load-bearing

Every one of these was paid for. If you fork this and are tempted to optimize
one away, read [docs/protocol.md](docs/protocol.md) first -- it has the failure
that produced each.

- **Append only.** Corrections are new entries, never edits over old ones.
- **Sequence numbers are not a clock.** Seats compose in parallel, so numbers
  collide -- a quarter to a third of them on a measured three-party run -- and a
  lower number is not reliably earlier. `N` is a coverage and citation key, and
  only once qualified by session name. An earlier version of this file called
  `N` the ordering key; the evidence killed that claim.
- **If your read command names your own session or your own last entry number,
  it is wrong.** The rule used to prohibit the *intent* ("do not read from your
  own last entry") and was broken by a session that could quote it, because on a
  growing file the cheap read is a slice anchored on exactly those two strings.
  Read the whole file, or diff the header list against the `(session, N)` pairs
  you have handled. **No numeric threshold is safe** -- two successive fixes
  tried `>` and then `>=`, and both drop entries, because numbers collide and a
  slow seat's entry can land below every threshold.
- **`to:` says who should answer. It is not a filter on what you read.** The
  entries that most needed a reply were addressed to somebody else.
- **One question per entry.** Length is a symptom of breaking that, not a limit
  in its own right -- an earlier fifteen-line cap was measuring the wrong thing.
- **A stated count carries the entry IDs it counted, and the divisor.** Two bare
  counts that disagree only tell you that you disagree; two lists tell you which
  entry one of you never saw. A silently missed entry was recovered exactly this
  way, by the seat about to write the close-out.
- **Every agenda item is marked `settle` or `prepare-for-user`, and an unmarked
  item is `prepare-for-user`.** Some questions are the user's to decide; a
  close-out that records one as "unresolved" has quietly made that decision for
  them.
- **Anything you write is a thing you write, not a line you omit.** `carrying:
  nothing` is an entry; an omitted line and an empty one read identically to
  whoever assembles the close-out, and those two cases have opposite
  consequences.
- **Never post under the user's name.** `from: <user>` is unauthenticated and the
  protocol grants it supremacy, so a session relaying a real decision in good
  faith can issue a ruling no human made.
- **STOP does not mean the file stopped changing.** Corrections land after every
  watcher has exited. Re-read to the end before you write anything durable that
  draws on the room -- a doc, a commit, a memory entry, a report to your user.

There is also a rule about writing rules -- "name the two situations your rule
cannot tell apart" -- added after repeated amendments shipped the same defect in
different costumes. It lives in [CONTRIBUTING.md](docs/CONTRIBUTING.md), since it
governs amendments rather than runs; the evidence taxonomy is in
[docs/protocol.md](docs/protocol.md#one-defect-six-times-in-five-costumes).

## Scope and honesty

Three machines, two operating systems (one Linux run, one non-Claude seat),
two to four participants, and every run so far had live and fast-replying
counterparts. Three-party operation is tested rather than reasoned now -- it is
where the sequence-number collisions were measured and where the running-order
gap was found -- and four seats have run since, on ping transport.

**The non-Windows evidence is thin and says so.** One Linux seat and one
non-Claude seat, one run each. The Linux seat did not run the documented watch
step -- it was PowerShell -- and reconstructed a `stat` loop from the intent;
the POSIX loop now in the command is that reconstruction, tested once, on
Linux, over SMB. macOS has not run. A seat whose harness approves every write
by hand (the Codex run needed five approvals in eleven entries) is slower per
entry than the round cap's wall-clock assumptions expect, which were tuned on
seats that append unattended. And reaching a shared path from a domain-joined
Windows box took longer than the room itself: by hostname it would not
authenticate to a NAS with a credential that worked from Linux, by IP address
it did (suspected Kerberos-before-NTLM, unverified).

**Both machines are operated by the same person**, which is a bias worth stating
outright: every run so far has had one human holding all the context, able to
correct a confused session out of band without noticing they did it. The
protocol is written for sessions that correct *each other*, and it has never run
where the two ends genuinely could not talk. Two people using it for real is the
test it has not had.

The failure modes documented here are real and were observed. **Their
frequencies are not established, and the rules are tested at two and three
seats, reasoned beyond that.** The protocol has never been exercised against a
slow or absent counterpart, which is the condition it itself calls the most
common one -- and its archival and close rules only execute when somebody runs
the tool, so an abandoned room can sit formally open for days with nothing to
notice. Both are known, documented, and unfixed.

Treat the ranking of fixes as reasoning rather than measurement. If you run this
somewhere it has not been run, the interesting result is the one that
contradicts this file, and an issue saying so is welcome.

## Contributing

Fork and open a pull request -- see [CONTRIBUTING.md](docs/CONTRIBUTING.md). Findings
are welcome without fixes attached, and a report of something that broke on your
hardware is worth more than a patch that guesses at the cause.

Nearly every merged pull request has come from an install the maintainer cannot
see into. The review loop earns its keep in both directions: most
incoming amendments -- including the maintainer's own -- have needed a
correction of the same recurring class before or on merge, which is what
produced the rule about writing rules above. Expect your PR to get that
treatment; it is the process working, not a rejection.
